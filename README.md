## About this dataset

This dataset was acquired using the [spine-generic protocol](http://spinalcordmri.org/protocols)
on multiple subjects, multiple sites and multiple MRI vendors and models. The list of subjects
is available in [participants.tsv](./participants.tsv).

This dataset follows the [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) convention.
The contributors have the necessary ethics & permissions to share the data publicly.

The dataset does not include any identifiable personal health information, including names,
zip codes, dates of birth, facial features on structural scans.

The processing pipeline to analyze this dataset is available in the [spine-generic repository](https://github.com/sct-pipeline/spine-generic).

The entire dataset is about **10GB**.

## Download

We are using a tool to manage large datasets alled `git-annex`. To download, dataset, you need to have `git` installed, and also [install `git-annex`](https://git-annex.branchable.com/install/) *at version 8*. Then run:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/spine-generic/data-multi-subject &&
cd data-multi-subject &&
git annex init &&
git annex get
~~~

You may **substitute** `git annex get` with more specific commands if you are only interested in certain subjects. For example:

```
get annex get sub-nwu01/ sub-nwu03/ sub-nwu04/ sub-oxfordFmrib04/ sub-tokyoSkyra*/
```
